# TeachJing's Desktop

This project was made to have a nice interface with access to labs, demos, editors, links, and anything I find useful I will build here for you guys :D

Keep checking back as I hope to add more!

I am repurposing this cool desktop that was initially built in React by blueedgetechno. Check it out here! https://github.com/blueedgetechno/windows11
